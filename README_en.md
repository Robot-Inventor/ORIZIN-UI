----

This is a library of UI-related that was created during the development of the ORIZIN series. This has been tested on Google Chrome 85. There is a possibility that this library will not work on older versions of Google Chrome or other web browsers. If you need to support web browsers other than Google Chrome, please be sure to check the operation beforehand.

## Usage

Here's a simple example using the ORIZIN UI.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>ORIZIN UI Sample</title>
</head>
<body>
    <input type="checkbox" class="toggle">    <!-- toggle switch -->
    <input type="text" class="underline_textbox">    <!-- textbox with underline -->
</body>
<script src="orizin_ui.js"></script>
<script>
    const ui = new ORIZIN_UI();
    ui.all();
</script>
</html>
```

The ``ui.all();`` part can be written separately as follows with exactly the same result.

```javascript
ui.toggle_switch();
ui.underline_textbox();
```

You can improve processing speed and prevent class name interference by executing only what you need individually.

If you want to run it separately, you can specify the target as a CSS selector. The default value is as follows

|Function|Default Value|
|:--|:--|
|``toggle_switch()``|``input[type=checkbox].toggle``|
|``underline_textbox()``|``input[type=text].underline_textbox``|

You can also specify a target with a CSS selector if you use the all() function. The following is an example of how to specify a target. The property name is ``(function name)_arg``, and the property values are passed to the functions as is. all() can either omit the arguments altogether or pass them with some properties omitted. In either case, the default value of each function's arguments is used for the omitted properties.

```javascript
const args = {
    toggle_switch_arg: "input[type=checkbox].toggle",
    underline_textbox_arg: "input[type=text].underline_textbox"
};
ui.all(args);
```

Whether you use the all() function or execute each function individually, you can specify the target's CSS selector as you like, but the target must be an input element and its type attribute must look like the following.

|Element|Type attribute|
|:--|:--|
|toggle switch|``checkbox``|
|textbox with underline|``text``|

### How to get/set the value

Values can be retrieved and set in the same way as regular check boxes for toggle switches and regular text boxes for underlined text boxes.

### Customize

The design of the UI generated by ORIZIN UI can be customized with CSS variables. You can customize the design within the style element **after the body start tag**.

The following is the default value of the CSS variable for the design of the toggle switch.

```css
:root {
    --toggle_width: 2.5rem;    /* width of toggle switch */
    --toggle_height: 1rem;    /* height of toggle switch */
    --toggle_border_thickness: 0.05rem;    /* thickness of the toggle switch outline */
    --toggle_border_color: gray;    /* color of the toggle switch outline */
    --toggle_disabled_color: white;    /* background color when the toggle switch is off */
    --toggle_enabled_color: #adff99;    /* background color when the toggle switch is on */
    --toggle_handle_color: white;    /* color of the toggle switch handle */
    --toggle_handle_radius: calc(var(--toggle_height) + 0.4rem);    /* handle diameter of toggle switch */
}
```

The following are the default values of CSS variables for the underlined text box design.

```css
:root {
    --underline_color_normal: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);    /* normal color of underline */
    --underline_color_focused: #ff6a00;    /* underline color during text entry */
    --underline_thickness: 0.15rem;    /* thickness of underline */
    --underline_textbox_width: 50%;    /* width of textbox */
}
```
